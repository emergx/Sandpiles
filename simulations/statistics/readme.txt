This folder contains simulation results in the form of numpy arrays.
The first number(s) gives the dimension(s), e.g.
100_simulation_1000000_drops_random.npy are results of a simulation with 1 million random drops on a 1D sandbox of length 100
100x100_simulation_1000000_drops_random.npy are results of a simulation with 1 million random drops on a 2D sandbox of length 100
