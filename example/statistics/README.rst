Simulation results
====================================

This folder contains simulation results in the form of numpy arrays.
The prefix gives the dimension(s), the suffix indicates the model e.g.

.. code-block:: bash
   
   100_simulation_1000000_drives_random_crit_slope_5_custom.npy

are results of a simulation of the custom model with 1 million drives on a random site on a 1D sandbox of length 100 with critical slope 5

.. code-block:: bash

   100x100_simulation_1000000_drives_random_btw.npy

are results of a simulation of the BTW model with 1 million drives on a random site on a 2D sandbox of length 100
