Critical sandboxes
==================

This folder contains sandboxes in a state of SOC after simulation. The file name contains all necessary information.
The prefix gives the dimension(s), the suffix gives the model e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

   100_sandbox_1000000_drives_random_crit_slope_5_custom.npy

is a 1D sandbox of the custom model after 1 million drives on a random site on a 1D sandbox of length 100 with critical slope 5

.. code-block:: bash

   100_sandbox_1000000_drives_random_btw.npy

is a 1D sandbox of the BTW model after 1 million drives on a random site on a 1D sandbox of length 100
