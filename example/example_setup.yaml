### Example setup file. Change the variables down below and execute the script like:
### python sandpile_btw.py --setup example_setup.yaml
### to start the simulation.
### The simulation variables are explained down below and a description as well as possible values for them are given.

### Specifiy the length of the sandbox on which the simulation is done ###

# Sandbox of length 100
length: 100

# Sandboxes of several lengths. Simulation is done for each dimension for each length
# length: [10, 30, 50]

### Specifiy dimension of the sandbox on which simulation is done###

# Sandbox of dimension 2
dimension: 2

# Sandboxes of several dimensions. Simulation is done for each dimension for each length
# dimension: [1, 2]

### Number of total sand grains to be dropped ###

# Drop 10000 grains on sandbox
total_drops: 10000

### Critical sand pile height of the sandbox ###

# This will be selected according to the dimension (crit_pile = 2 * dimension). For several dimensions d1, d2, ..., this is tuple of (2 * d1, 2 * d2, ...)
crit_pile: null

# Set a critical pile height manually. This can be done but is not forseen.
# crit_pile: 8

### Specify point on which each grain of sand from total_drops will be dropped ###

# Drop on random point within the sandbox
point: null

# Drop on point (0, 0) within a 2D sandbox
# point: [0, 0]

### Whether or not to save the result of the simulation; Stored in numpy arrays with extension .npy ###

# Do not store simulation results
save_sim: false

# Save in simulations/statistics/. If this location does not exists, it is created.
# save_sim: true

# Save in specified loaction and file
# save_sim: '/path/to/location/my_simulation.npy' 

### Whether or not to save the resulting, critical sandbox; Stored in numpy arrays with extension .npy ###

# Do not store critical sandbox
save_sbox: false

# Save in simulations/sandboxes/. If this location does not exists, it is created.
# save_sbox: true

# Save in specified loaction and file
# save_sbox: '/path/to/location/my_sandbox.npy' 

### Whether or not to plot the results after the simulation is over ###

# Do not plot results
plot_res: false

# Do not plot results
# plot_res: true

### Whether or not to plot the live evolution of the sandpile dynamics; only possible for 1 or 2 dimensions ###

# Plot live evolution
plot_sim: true

# Do not plot live evolution
# plot_sim: false
